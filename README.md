## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Delta 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Delta 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Delta 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the z1-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z1-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the z2-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z2-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z3-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z3-axis assembly.

### Base :
The base provides stability and support for the entire Delta 3D printer structure. It houses the electronics, power supply, and other components.

### Holder :
In a Delta 3D printer, the holder may refer to the filament spool holder, which holds the filament spool in place and ensures smooth and controlled feeding of filament into the extruder.


### Rod :
Delta 3D printers use three vertical rods (typically made of smooth or threaded rods) to form the framework of the printer. These rods provide structural support and guide the movement of the print head assembly.


### Top cover :
The top cover in a Delta 3D printer serves as a protective enclosure, enclosing the internal components and providing a controlled environment for printing.

### Top cover frame :
The top cover frame provides structural support to the top cover and helps maintain its stability.

### Linear rail :
Delta 3D printers typically do not use linear rails. Instead, they utilize a system of arms and carriages that guide the movement of the print head assembly in a delta configuration.

### Motor :
Motors in a Delta 3D printer drive the movement of the print head assembly. Typically, three stepper motors are used to control the vertical movement of the arms, enabling precise positioning of the print head.

### Base :
In a Delta 3D printer, the base serves as the foundation and support structure for the entire printer.

### Bed :
The bed in a Delta 3D printer is the print surface where the object is built. It may be a heated platform or a non-heated surface, depending on the printer's specifications. The bed provides a stable foundation for the printed object.


### Slide with connector :
In a Delta 3D printer, the slide with connector is not commonly used. The movement of the print head assembly is achieved through a system of parallel arms connected to carriages, which slide along the vertical rods.

### Connecting Rods :
Connecting rods in a Delta 3D printer link the arms of the printer to the print head assembly. They transmit the motion from the stepper motors to the print head, enabling precise movement in a delta configuration.
 
### Extruder :
The extruder in a Delta 3D printer performs the same function as in other 3D printers. It melts and extrudes the filament, controlling the material flow and depositing it layer by layer to create the 3D printed object.

### Pins :
Pins in a Delta 3D printer are used as fasteners or connectors to hold various components together securely.
### Motor with gear :
A motor with gears is not typically used in the Delta 3D printer design. Instead, stepper motors directly drive the movement of the print head assembly.
### LCD : 

The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) in a Delta 3D printer serves as the user interface, displaying information about the printing process, providing access to printer settings, and allowing users to control and monitor the printer's operation.
